# The akka/akka Gitter Channel

This channel is available for all Akka enthusiastsâ€”newbies as well as gurusâ€”for the exchange of knowledge and the coordination of efforts around Akka; it is a community effort and resource and not backed by Typesafe. For more structured discussions please refer to [the akka-user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-user).

Instead of a long Code of Conduct we rely upon common sense: be kind and respectful to those who are already here and to those who come after you, harassment of any kind will not be tolerated; in case of trouble contact [akka.official](mailto:akka.official@gmail.com).

Please also note that this is not an official Akka support channel, for commercial support please contact [Typesafe](mailto:info@typesafe.com) or visit [Typesafe.com](http://www.typesafe.com/).
