# The akka/dev Gitter Channel

This channel is available for all Akka contributors for the exchange of knowledge and the coordination of efforts around Akka; it is a community effort and resource and not backed by Typesafe. For more structured discussions please refer to [the akka-user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-user).

This channel is not meant to be used for the discussion of questions or ideas around the usage of Akka, it is reserved for coordinating pull requests etc. Please use the akka/akka channel for general discussion.

Instead of a long Code of Conduct we rely upon common sense: be kind and respectful to those who are already here and to those who come after you, harassment of any kind will not be tolerated; in case of trouble contact [akka.official](mailto:akka.official@gmail.com).

Please also note that this is not an official Akka support channel, for commercial support please contact [Typesafe](mailto:info@typesafe.com) or visit [Typesafe.com](http://www.typesafe.com/).
